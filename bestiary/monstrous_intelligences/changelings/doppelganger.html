<div class="mdc-typography--headline2">Doppelganger</div>
<p>Doppelgangers are a source of acute paranoia for those in the Eastern Kingdom unlucky enough to know of their existence - creatures that can unerringly assume the physical form of, it is believed, any other person - creatures with no souls, no qualms or morality - who would as soon as kill you as smile at you. Many coups and peasant uprisings have been executed based on the belief (or purported belief) that the nobility has been infiltrated by these monsters: their lust for wealth and power is legendary in folklore. As with everything there are figments of truth strewn within the rightful fear that surrounds them: they lack many of the qualms of the species they live amongst are restrained by - even amongst the vistime, they can only simulate a filial kindness and warmth - and human myths such as justice, kindness and mercy are entirely beyond them. They are not, however, masterminds or vanguards of some insidious insurrection - their origins are as unknown to them as they are to those families they are born into or (if the rumours are to be believed) delivered into, in the place of a ‘normal’ child. A doppelganger lives its life entirely alone - without understanding of any sort of connection to other creatures - not even other doppelgangers. The motivations and the aspirations they pursue are as varied as any other species - but almost always go to the grave with them.</p>
