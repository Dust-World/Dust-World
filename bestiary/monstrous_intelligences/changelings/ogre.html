<div class="mdc-typography--headline2">Ogre</div>
<p>The atrocities and monstrous acts of ogres have led to their being the foremost among changelings in the minds of the common folk: many a child has been scared into obedience by tales of ravenous ogres that hide behind a twisted human visage. An Ogre appears as a human for the first part of their life - being born to human parents - it is believed that a human child is swapped for the offspring of an ogre - or that ogres quicken in parents who are cursed by an unrecognized ogre. Whatever the means of their creation, they begin their lives as strong, uncommonly fair, hale and intelligent children who grow and mature completely indistinguishable from their adopted peers. It is at the onset of adulthood that the ogreâ€™s inhuman nature asserts itself - manifesting as a cruelty and manipulativeness that covers for a growing need to consume human flesh. Often this drives the ogre away from their home, to pursue whatever lifestyle they can to feed their burgeoning hunger. As they eat, they grow - gradually towering over humanity as their once homely features slough and distort to match their developing bulk. Their intelligence remains, however and as their disguise strips away so does any inhibition or fear of discovery. They never stop growing, either - with legends telling of ogres that towered over homes as they dragged victims from their bedroom windows to eat whole.</p>
