<div class="mdc-typography--headline2">The Dreaming Cities of Doyoc</div>
<p>The origins of the Dreamers are unknown - they themselves claim to have always been in waiting - that their faith is the expression of an idea that predates even the Empires of the past. What is known is that about a generation ago, in the far north where the Doyoc plains meet the sea, a fervent cult arose within the half sunken walls of a ruined city: working miracles of immense spiritual power, these ‘Dreamers’ offered salvation from a wretched life in the shadows of the past - a future that could be seized now, be perceived now. It quickly swallowed the chiefdom in a sudden outpouring of violence as the ruling class, infiltrated and undermined by drugged, masked fanatics of the cult were toppled. So rose the first Dreaming City - its ancient Imperial edifices defaced or pulled down and its tombs upturned, their treasures immolated or melted down. Few noticed. But it was to be a pattern repeated all across the plains - very slowly: beginning with the poor, the enslaved - spreading through the nomads by zealous missionaries. Overlooked, it grows and escapes through servants into the halls of free people and then higher and higher - it’s soporific promises of liberation and miracles of perception ensnaring positions of influence. By the time the Dreamers arrive in their chaotic, thronging armies there are already sympathisers ready to throw open the gates and allow the ‘emancipation’ to begin.</p>
<p>Today, the Dreaming Cities are a confederation of such liberated dominions. As their numbers have swelled, so has their power - unifying the disparate tribes and peoples under their blank banner to achieve feats of engineering and construction once considered impossible given the moribund, lifeless landscape. As a people, the Dreamers are an unsettling, otherworldly presence - dressing uniformly, seeming to look through outsiders and speaking in a cipher of jargon and esoteric allusions or allegory. Their cities are cloistered, passionless places shrouded in a heady smog of incense and burning ritual herbs, haunted by chanting and toneless, ‘mind-focusing’ music. Their advance has been checked as it crashes against the borders of more settled, stable lands where wary rulers have taken to rooting out and destroying Dreamers. But it is widely believed only to be a matter of time until the Dreamers choose to take a more direct approach…</p>
