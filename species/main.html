<div class="smui-paper smui-paper--raised smui-paper--elevation-z1 smui-paper--rounded"><div class="mdc-typography--headline2">Bestiary of Dust</div>
<p>The lands of both the East and West are home to all variety of creature that would be familiar to a visitor from Earth: cattle are reared in the Kingdoms, camels roam the deserts beyond Tak’ra and vermin of every description can be found scurring within settlements, or crawling across unwashed hides. These ‘mundane’ animals are not the subject of this bestiary, except when a notable variation on their form can be found - such as the specimen being of an immense size.</p>
<p>While available in an alphabetical index, several arbitrary groupings are available, based on how their members are commonly encountered:</p>
<ul><li><a href="./playable"><span class="mdc-typography--body1">Playable Species</span></a> - also known as <em>humankin</em> or <em>demihumans</em>, these are the humanoid species that populate the Eastern Kingdoms. While not an exhaustive list of species that have complex social and reasoning skills, or that form communities and cultures, they are the primary focus of adventures in Dust World.</li>
<li><span class="mdc-typography--body1">Non-Playable Sapients</span> - all other species that might be clumsily regarded as ‘intelligent’ (though might not immediately appear to be). These entities may form societies similar to those of the humankin, or might have ways of life completely alien to them. The most well-known of such species are the Krikyth - a eusocial, insectoid species whom the Eastern Kingdoms have (so far) failed to understand beyond the threat they pose.</li>
<li><span class="mdc-typography--body1">Monstrous Intelligences</span> - where the previous category refers to intellegent <em>species</em> that possess a self-directed agency in the world, Monstrous Intelligences refer to <em>entities</em> at large who cross boundaries of species and indeed of biology all together. Covering beings that were formerly living, those that are not, nor have ever been alive at all, and living beings whose nature is (in the opinion of others) malicious or inimical to peaceful coexistence.</li>
<li><span class="mdc-typography--body1">Monstrous Creatures</span> - the first of the categories not dealing with sapience, these entities may or may not be sentient and may or may not be natural in origin. This is a broad class that covers the mindless undead, beings formed of spiritual force and things made from magic itself: they are chiefly linked by not being extant on Earth.</li>
<li><span class="mdc-typography--body1">Aberrations</span> - this is a category of creatures that are warped or unusual variations of a mundane animal or plant.</li></ul>
