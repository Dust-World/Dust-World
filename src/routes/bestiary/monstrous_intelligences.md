## Monstrous Intelligences
Sapience is not exclusive to the humankin of the Kingdoms. It is found to greater or lesser extents in a number of alien or monstrous forms. These beings are set apart from civilization by aberrant biologies or natures that are (it appears to humanity) malicious or inimical to peaceful coexistence - largely they exist in the margins, having been driven into the shadows, or so it is said, by the Old Empire that came before. These are almost always the greatest foes of humans and demihumans - their intellect and strange needs making them vicious hunters indeed. More terrifying, however, are those creatures that find means to live within civilization - hunting and surviving beneath notice.
