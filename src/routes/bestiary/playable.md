## Playable Species:
Humans and other *'demihuman'* (or *'humankin'* ) species have lived alongside each other since written records began. While some regions are considered to be the native ‘homes’ of these species - such as the duarr’s ancestral ties to what is now known as the ‘Blighted Coast’, most species can be found all across the Kingdoms - save for the few whose human rulers have made it a policy to expel other species. Prejudice is not unheard of - but rarely given much heed beyond the most isolated and homogenous regions. Humans are the most populous species in the Kingdoms, followed by the apye and the duarr: other species can be found in small enclaves or integrated into society wherever one goes.
