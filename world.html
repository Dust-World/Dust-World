<p>Dust World is a setting for any fantasy role playing system. Featuring a world ravaged by calamity both magical and ecological, Dust World’s inhabitants face an uncertain future chained to a mysterious past.</p>
<h4>Anything But Typical</h4>
<p>Dust World blends to expected and the unexpected, holding no fantasy tropes sacred and looking to fold old ideas and new to create a world which rewards and encourages exploration, adventure and mystery.</p>
<p>Some examples of what can be found in <strong>Dust World</strong>:</p>
<ul><li>The otherworldly and toxic <strong>Dust</strong> - a parallel biosphere that perpetually encroaches from the lofty <strong>Devil Spine Mountains</strong>. Fungal in nature and given to poisoning and spreading through precious water courses, it is a threat to everything except those monstrous creatures that are native to it.</li>
<li>A world without <strong>gods</strong> - where belief and shared culture conjures divine power, not the might of deities. The power of one’s ancestors drives the zeal of Paladins, the traditions of one’s home fuels its clerics: these <strong>spirit hosts</strong> produce spontanious miracles when they are strongly felt - but can also fall afoul of predatory Witches and spiritual maladies, leading to nightmarish manifestations of pain and fear.</li>
<li><strong>Iron Wasting</strong> rots swords and ploughshares alike - spread by <strong>Dust</strong>, it is a lichen-like growth that slowly spreads through even the most refined metal, rendering it brittle. Only steel can resist its touch - the secret of which is as jealously guarded as the scant few uninfected iron mines.</li>
<li>Wily <a href="./bestiary/playable_species/groth"><strong>groth</strong></a> launch daring raids from the purple slopes of their mountainous homes, needle-toothed <a href="./bestiary/playable_species/vistime"><strong>vistime</strong></a> lurk in the marshes and fens at the edge of civilisation and stoic <a href="./bestiary/playable_species/duarr"><strong>duarr</strong></a> struggle for survival as their homelands sour and their cultures succumb. The <em>humankin</em> - or thinking peoples of Dust World are wholly new riffs on classic fantasy tropes - offering several different mindsets free of biological determinism, but ripe for xenofiction.</li>
<li>Strange and dire <a href="./gazetteer/regions"><strong>lands</strong></a> - from the flooded, rotting expanses of the Plague Deltas to the twilight realm of the Sunken Forest - and West into the unkown, Dust World provides vistas ripe for adventure, dripping with a moribund majesty and a sense of a lost past.</li></ul>
<h4>Flexible and Modular</h4>
<p>Made with classic fantasy rulesets in mind, Dust World can be scaled to suit a DM’s appetite for strangeness - its various quirks and oddities not threatening to unduly tie it to any one system. Any of its components can be extracted from the others and placed into your own homebrew setting without difficulty.</p>
<p>Many features of the setting are unusual, but not necessarily paradigm-shattering takes on otherwise classic dungeon fantasy staples: ogres are a malignant form of changeling whose predatory intelligence and unquenchable appetites for the flesh of thinking creatures cause it to grow constantly though its life; ghosts are symptoms of malignant sicknesses in spirit hosts that might be coaxed into existance by the fell machinations of wicked Clerics;</p>
<p>Regions and settings are without prescriptive maps or definite locations to encourage players to devise their own homelands and corners of the cramped and decaying East. The enterprising Dungeon Master can easily extract areas they aren’t fond of, insert new ones of their own creation or transpose entire regions into other worlds.</p>
<p>Where rules are provided, they can be filtered by their associated system using the toggles on the <a href>Ruleset</a> page.</p>
<h4>Multiple Ways to Play</h4>
<p>Dust World was originally created for a ‘Westmarches’ style campaign and this is reflected in the content relating to the wild, forgotten West. The East, in comparison, is left vaguer and (initially) less defined to encourage player contributions. This is reflected in the unnumbered Eastern Kingdoms and the swathes of land that are purposely undefined.</p>
<p>Dust World has an emphasis on travel, exploration and discovery - but it is also home to large cities, royal courts filled with intreague and settled lands riven by war - there are opportunities for many kinds of campaigns within its mouldering landscape.</p>
<h4>Want to Know More?</h4>
<p>Whether you’re a player in a Dust World campaign, or a Dungeon Master looking for content, this site contains an extensive <a href="./bestiary">bestiary</a> that details the multitude of flora and fauna, be their magical or mundane that can be found in the East and West. It also has a <a href="./gazetteer">gazetteer</a> that has short articles on regions, polities and organisations that adventurers might run into.</p>
<p>There are also pages dedicated to:</p>
<ul><li>Matters of the <a href="./supernatural/">supernatural</a> such as the nature of magic (be it divine or arcane), the mysteries of psionicism and the commonly understood lore of Spirit Hosts, Daemons and other unnatural entities.</li>
<li>A <a href>guide to belief</a> that describes many of the more prominent faiths and orders of spiritualists that can be found.</li>
<li><a href>Rules and mechanics</a> for those interested in running games in Dust World.</li></ul>
<p>Wherever your travels take you, remember: tomorrow is not a certainty, today will surely end and yesterday is soon forgotten. Keep your axe at your side and your iron greased: adventure awaits!</p>
